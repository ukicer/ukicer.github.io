        <h1>Venue</h1>

        <p>Cambridge is a historical town north of London with first settlements dating back to Roman times. It is most famous for the University of Cambridge and its 31 colleges that are located in and around the city centre. Popular activities in Cambridge include punting on the river Cam and exploring the many small shops, museums and the rich history of the town. But Cambridge does not just have touristic appeal. We are very proud of our deep-rooted connections with computing and computing education, starting of course with notable Cambridge University alumni Charles Babbage and Alan Turing. In 1949, Professor Sir Maurice Wilkes of the University’s Mathematical Laboratory led the building of the EDSAC computer, which became the world’s first program-stored computer to enter regular service. After running a series of computing summer schools and other less formal computing educational programmes, the new department started the world’s first formal course in computer science in 1953: The Diploma of Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing.</p>

        <p>We very much look forward to welcoming you to the city and the University. As you prepare for the conference, you can follow these links to find out more about the history of the University and what to do in Cambridge.</p>

        <h2>Conference venue</h2>

        <p>The conference location is the West Hub building (JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0US), which is directly opposite the Department of Computer Science and Technology building, and a 30-minute walk from the city centre.</p>

        <h2>Accommodation</h2>
        <p>We have arranged for a number of reserved rooms at the Hyatt Centric Cambridge, which is a 20-minute walk from West Hub. More information about how to book accommodation will be shared soon.</p>

        <h2>Transport</h2>
        <p>Most major train routes to Cambridge lead through either London King’s Cross or London Liverpool Street stations. Travel time from London is approximately 60-90 min. Train tickets can be bought on <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/en-us">Trainline</a>, which is also a useful tool to find the best connections and train times. All train tickets that require use of the underground/tube in London already include the tube fare between the relevant stations. London King's Cross is adjacent to London St. Pancreas (less than 5 minutes walk) where the Eurostar arrives.</p>
