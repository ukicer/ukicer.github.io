        <p><b>Abstract:</b> This talk will explore the journey of Computing Education in Ireland, beginning with its early attempts in the 1970s and culminating in the introduction of a formal Senior Cycle curriculum in 2018 (comparable to Key Stages 5 and 6) as well as some interesting attempts we tried along the way. The presentation will then turn to the current educational landscape, offering an overview of how this curriculum was designed and was implemented across schools. Keith will examine the challenges faced by educators as they adapt to teaching a subject that differs significantly—both technically and pedagogically—from their traditional disciplines. He will also highlight initiatives aimed at building teacher capacity and fostering self-efficacy in the delivery of Computing Education. The presentation will also consider the role that third-level institutions and chapters like the SIGCSEire chapter have played in supporting this transition, through contributions such as teacher education programmes, curriculum development input, and collaborative professional development initiatives. However, it will also reflect on the difficulties encountered in aligning third-level priorities and structures with the rapidly evolving needs of the school system and how EU guidelines direct the trajectory of Computing Education. Drawing upon his research and active engagement in national curriculum support efforts—including professional learning programmes and industry-linked certification—Keith will reflect on the practicalities of implementation, identify the most impactful supports to date, and propose ways in which third-level institutions can more effectively contribute to the continued development and success of Computing Education in schools.</p>

        <p><b>Bio:</b> Keith is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Enterprise Computing and Digital Transformation in TU Dublin. Keith's' primary area of research is in Computer Science Education (with an emphasis on inclu- sion) which spans third, second and primary levels. The main focus of Keith's' research at third level (including my PhD) was the early identification of students who were at risk of failing or dropping out of Computer Science (using machine learning techniques), as well as interventions to try and reduce attrition rates. Keith's' research also focuses on gender and inclusion, with an aim to reduce stereotypes and promote the Computer Science discipline across all levels of education. Keith's primary area of teaching is in Software Development, (CS1 and CS2) and Applied Machine Learning with Artificial Intelligence. Keith is the program coordinator of TU862 Computing with AI and ML undergraduate. Keith has also developed, delivered and coordinated a wide range of other modules. To complement Keith's' Computer Science Education research at third level, Keith has also been significantly involved in primary and second level Computer Science Education, from the Governmental level to formal and informal teacher professional development, to leading a large-scale national, primary and second level Computer Science outreach and research programme.</p>

        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Generative AI has the potential to disrupt education, whether used by learners or their teachers. The impact of GenAI tools on learning outcomes at school level is not yet known, although there is some promise from initial empirical work. However, given the impacts of Generative AI on society, there is a need to educate children and young people about AI, even while the educational impact of using AI is explored.
            <br>
            <br>
            This talk will be jointly presented by a team of researchers and teachers who collaborated to develop lessons to support secondary school teachers in teaching their classes about AI. We will describe the principles behind the AI curriculum across four strands of work: the relationship of AI to Children's Rights and ethics, AI literacy, critical thinking, and the responsible use of AI to support learning. We will explain our AI Teachers in Residence model and why we thought it was important to co-develop it with teachers across a range of secondary subjects, rather than focusing solely on computer science teachers.  Some of our AI Teachers in Residence will present the materials they created and share how they have been used in classrooms so far. There will be opportunities for the audience to discuss with the teachers how best to teach AI in schools.</p>

<h3 id="workshops">Workshops</h3>
<p><b>Workshop 1: Conducting thematic analysis in Computing Education Research</b><br>
Presenter: Julia Crossley<br>
Abstract: This proposal describes a workshop on conducting thematic analysis in Computer Science Education research. While empirical studies often prioritize large datasets and quantitative methods, this workshop concentrates on a particular approach in qualitative methodologies that enable thick, insight rich descriptions. By discussing the value of thematic analysis, the presenter aims to give a methodological overview and toolkit to CSEd researchers. The session will be particularly valuable for researchers seeking to study their data in depth and develop an informed yet instinctive approach to qualitative research.</p>

<p><b>Workshop 2: Exploring AI Workflow: Simple Practices for Honest, Transparent, and Re-usable Work</b><br>
Presenters: Jake Van Clief, Pavlos Andreadis<br>
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is emerging as a new language layer between human intent and computational execution. Just as programming languages bridge human logic and machine code, AI now interprets natural human expression into complex digital applications. This workshop examines practical ways for educators to navigate this shift, recognising that industry increasingly values graduates who can communicate with and through AI systems. Over a 90‑minute, practice‑oriented session, we surface strategies for making AI workflows visible and pedagogically useful in teaching and assessment. Through facilitated exploration and discussion, we consider how student–AI interactions can be understood, guided, and critiqued within diverse disciplinary contexts. By the end of the session, participants will leave with a clearer vocabulary, a set of heuristics, and adaptable exemplars for framing meaningful engagement with AI tools alongside subject matter.</p>

<p><b>RIPPA 1: Dancing with Dilemma: Computer Science Education Research in Teaching-Focused Academics' Promotion</b><br>
Presenters: Cristina Adriana Alexandru, Duncan Hull, Martin Goodfellow<br>
Abstract: Despite the growing number of teaching-focused academics worldwide, a fair and consistent approach to their promotion is lacking. Research, a focus of more traditional roles, is still prioritised in many universities. Even promotion requirements written specifically for teaching-focused academics may confusingly hint at research, in particular educational/pedagogic research. As a result, teaching-focused academics may feel tempted to go into educational/pedagogic research. This poses a number of challenges at all career stages. The aim of this RIPPA is to study the specific promotion requirements of teaching-focused academics in Computer Science, the challenges that they face when going into Computer Science Education research, and the support offered by their institutions, before providing recommendations.</p>

<p><b>RIPPA 2: Escape to Learn: Exploring Non-linear Puzzle-Based Learning in Computing Education</b><br>
Presenters: Salma Elsayed and Marwan Mohammed<br>
Abstract: Escape room-inspired activities are increasingly used in education for their immersive, engaging nature. However, most implementations are linear and centrally controlled, limiting pedagogical depth. Physical escape rooms offer richer experiences but are costly and impractical at scale. This RIPPA explores a scalable alternative: non-linear, digital or hybrid escape room designs embedded within teaching materials. Addressing student disengagement in higher education, the project investigates whether playful, puzzle-based formats can improve engagement, enjoyment, and understanding. Focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) education, the activity builds on an initial implementation to bring educators together to co-develop, trial, and evaluate this approach. The group will share experiences, analyse data, and produce outputs to assess its pedagogical value. The findings may extend to wider computing education.</p>

        <p>Abstract: I have become rather &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;het up&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; about the use of AI applications in teaching and learning.  I am worried that the digital divide will widen rather than narrow with the increasing use of this technology.  A question that bothers me is, "Why are some of our students better at using the output from AI applications than others?" and what can we do about this? I want to get us all thinking and talking about this issue. I will be rather self-indulgent and share my two favourite theories from general education and sociology that may help us think more deeply about AI interaction literacy.</p>

<p>Upon registering, attendees can sign up to one of 2 FREE collocated pre-conference events taking place on Wednesday 3rd of September 2025. Please note that these events have limited capacity and only attendees who have signed up for them will be admitted. They will include lunch and refreshments.</p>

<p><b>Pre-conference Event 1: "GenAI Integration in Computer Science Education"</b><br>
Presenter: Pavlos Andreadis<br>
Time: September 3, 1pm-5pm<br>
Location: Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton St, Edinburgh EH8 9AB<br>
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) presents both a challenge and an opportunity for Computer Science (CS) education. This interactive event builds on key insights from a recent study* exploring how GenAI is being integrated into CS teaching, assessment, and learning at the University of Edinburgh. We'll share emerging patterns, pitfalls, and points of tension identified through staff and student engagement, and use these as a springboard for collective reflection – surfacing shared concerns and identifying concrete next steps, at the level of course design, institutional policy, or collaborative experimentation.</p>

<p>Participants will engage in a practical, hands-on exercise using GenAI tools within a controlled CS education context – designed to be directly useful, while also shedding light on effective and ineffective practices. This session is aimed at course organisers, instructors, and teaching-focused researchers seeking to make informed, context-sensitive decisions about GenAI in their teaching.</p>

<p>Come prepared to think critically, test practically, and contribute meaningfully to a rapidly evolving conversation that will shape the future of CS education.</p>

<p>Join us to learn, experiment, and help define how GenAI should serve – not distort – the goals of CS education.</p>

<p>* Principals' Teaching Award Scheme-funded; GenAI Integration in Computer Science Education.</p>

<p><b>Pre-conference Event 2: "Embedding Accessibility in Computer Science Education"</b><br>
Presenter: Aurora Constantin<br>
Time: September 3, 1pm-5pm<br>
Location: Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton St, Edinburgh EH8 9AB<br>
Abstract: Teaching accessibility in higher education (HE) is essential for equity promotion, legal compliance, professional readiness, diversity, inclusion, ethical fulfilment, innovation encouragement, and leadership in fostering an inclusive society. Yet, recent studies highlight a significant gap in formal education on accessibility. This interactive event aims to explore the current landscape of teaching accessibility within Computer Science (CS) Higher Education (HE). Focusing on the experiences of educators and teaching support providers, the session will collaboratively identify key challenges and gather insights into the support mechanisms needed to embed accessibility more effectively into CS curricula.</p>

<p>The event will include a talk titled "Bridging the Accessibility Gap Between Academia and Industry?" by Heather Hepburn, Head of Accessibility at Skyscanner. We will also share findings from a Principal's Teaching Award Scheme (PTAS) project conducted in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, shedding light on current practices and systemic barriers. Additionally, we will present a preliminary list of recommendations for instilling accessibility into CS education. This aims to spark institutional dialogue and inform broader CS education strategies.</p>

<p>This event offers a space for reflection, peer exchange, and the co-creation of actionable strategies to enhance teaching accessibility in CS education across institutions.</p>

<h2><a id="DC">Doctoral Consortium</a></h2>
<p>The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference Doctoral Consortium (DC) provides an opportunity for doctoral students to engage with peers and work with researchers to reflect on the wider computing education research landscape and expand it through connection and collaboration.</p>


<h2><a id="WiP">Works-in-Progress (WiP) Workshop</a></h2>
<p>The WiP is a small, intimate venue, a 'grown-up doctoral consortium' for academics. The aspiration is to bring together individuals to act as critical friends to discuss and nurture ideas and projects that are in progress. The 'works' from participants vary in terms of type, from research papers to projects, and progress, from embryonic to near-completion.</p>


                    <h2><a id="workshopProposals">Workshops</a></h2>
                    <p>We invite proposals for running 1.5 hour workshops. The workshops should be relevant to British and Irish educators (in a university or school setting) and/or computing science education researchers. Example workshops may be on the
                        use of research techniques (e.g. qualitative methods), grant writing, pedagogical techniques (e.g. peer instruction), tools (e.g. programming environments, assessment tools), or any other topic which may be relevant to conference
                        attendees.

                    <h2><a id="rippa">Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs)</a></h2>

                    <p>Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs) are a relatively new form of collaborative, community-forming activity for Computing Science education research and practice at UKICER. </p>
 
                    <p>The aim is to bring practitioners and researchers together in computing science education to form networks, exchanges ideas, form collaborations and put research into practice, incorporate research into practice or improving practice. </p>
                     
                    <p>RIPPAs span several months and participants are expected to commit to participating in a small number of online workshops as well as conducting some activity in their context, such as incorporating research into practice, collecting data and/or conducting research. </p>

                    <h3>Participation and Commitment</h3>

                    <p>
                        The specific participation and commitment requirements depends on the RIPPA, but broadly RIPPAs require participants to: 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>  <b>Attend start-up workshop at UKICER</b>. The workshop will introduce the RIPPA, methodologies and approaches used as well as provide an opportunity for participants to get to know each other and learn about what is happening across the community. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Perform activity.</b> RIPPA participants are expected to perform some activity as part of the project. This activity could be to conduct research in their own context, incorporate research into their own practice or improve their practice. Participants would then share their contributes back to the group remotely. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Attend interim workshop.</b> The workshop - which will usually be online, unless RIPPA leaders can facilitate in-person meeting - will give participants an opportunity to share their contributions as well as analyse results and discuss any insights from the activity. The group will then begin to form it into a complete outcome and decide next steps. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Capstone workshop.</b> The final workshop to pull together any remaining work involved in the activity and form into an artefact that can be disseminated among the community through the optimal channel, such as UKICER or the Computing Education Practice (CEP). 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Relax and unwind at a wrap-up dinner.</b> Wrap-up meal and opportunity to reflect on the experience and plan future collaborations with other rippers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The focus of RIPPAs is the participants and the expectation is that they will achieve the following from participating in a RIPPA: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Strengthened knowledge and skills in research and practice.</b> Dependent on the specific RIPPA, the expectation is that participants will strengthen their research knowledge and skills. This could be awareness emerging teaching practice and how to investigate it, appropriate methodologies for computing education research (CER) and/or deepened appreciation of the state of the art in CER. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Strengthened and expanded network of collaborators.</b>  Form connections with academics, scholars and researchers from across the computing science education community with similar interests and challenges. Valuable not only for conducting future research investigations but also to gain insight into innovative practice in other institutions as well as creating bonds with other academics to discuss on-going sector challenges and how to solve them. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Publication.</b> The expectation is that outcomes of RIPPAs will be high-quality, multi-institutional studies that are authentic and steeped in data from contexts spanning many different from many perspectives. Participants will be authors on such high-quality contributions that are difficult to devise and coordinate for most sole academics. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>RIPPA proposals that presenters would like to be considered for delivery at the conference and beyond must be be submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ukicer2025">EasyChair</a>. Authors should consult the detailed
                        submission format <a href="#authors">instructions and guidelines for RIPPA</a> prior to submission.</p>

<!--
                    <p>Accepted RIPPA proposals are included in the proceedings and accepted RIPPAs are expected to provide an update on the progress of the RIPPA in subsequent years as to track progress as well as share any problems or lessons learned. The progress (e.g. paper submitted or accepted at given event) on previous RIPPAs will be reported in future conference proceedings.</p>

<h2>RIPPA 2021: Spatial Skills</h2>

<p>
The RIPPA 2021 aims to find out whether a) first-year students with better spatial skills have better programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method), b) whether spatial skills change over a period of computing instruction and c) what demographic data contribute towards high spatial ability. Future goals of the project will be to investigate whether improving first-year students' spatial skills improves their programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method).

                            <h2><a id="WiPProposals">Works in Progress (WiP) workshop</a></h2>
                                <p>The Work in Progress (WiP) workshop is a specialised event for UKICER conference attendees who are established researchers in computing education research, or hold terminal degrees (such as PhDs). The aim of the workshop is to provide a community context in which attendees give and receive friendly and constructive feedback on their work. WiP is not appropriate for PhD students, who should consider the UKICER Doctoral Consortium.
                                </p>

                                <p>A WiP workshop is an excellent opportunity to discuss and develop ongoing work. WiP submissions are concrete, anchored in a specific topic, and may be centred on various elements of work, including (but not limited to):
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>A rejected paper</li>
                                    <li>A kernel of an idea</li>
                                    <li>A grant proposal</li>
                                    <li>A research project</li>
                                    <li>A study design</li>
                                    <li>An analysis approach</li>
                                  </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p>If accepted, attendees prepare a short primer on their work (4 page maximum) circulated in advance, this supports effective discussion. Depending on the number of participants we expect to spend 30 - 45 minutes discussing the work of each attendee.</p>

                                <h3 id="WiPA">Applying for the WiP Workshop</h3>

                    <p>The review process is broadly similar for all contributions to the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference that are published in the conference proceedings. </p>


                    <h3>Process for Papers and Posters</h3>
                    <p>
                        The review process for papers and posters is double-blind with authors required to submit anonymised artefacts. Each submission is reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee. Upon completion of reviews, reviewers enter the discussion
                        stage and are expected to discuss their reviews anonymously, especially when notable differences exist. The programme chair utilises discussions and reviews to determine an appropriate balance of accepted papers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <p>
                        Authors must ensure their submissions abide by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">ACM Conflict of Interest Policy (COI)</a>. Reviewers are required by chairs to identify any conflicts of
                        interest prior to being allocated any submissions to review. Authors are expected to inform any conflicts of interest prior or at the point of submission of any artefacts for review.
                    </p>

                    <h4><a id="proxy">Proxy chair and expert panel</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        Submissions that represent a conflict of interest for all conference chairs are passed to the proxy chair. The proxy chair assembles an expert panel of two or more members, the members are not required to be part of the programme committee. The members
                        of the expert panel are not known to the chairs. The proxy chair and expert panel consider the conflicted papers, reviews and any discussion amongst reviewers. The expert panel makes the final decision on the conflicted papers
                        and this is communicated to the conference chairs.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Process for Workshop</h3>
                    <p>The workshop submitted by proposers are considered by the Workshop chair. The submissions put forward by proposers are considered confidential.</p>

                    <h4>Research paper</h4>
                    <p>Each paper is allocated 25 minutes, which is made up of a 15 minute presentation, 5 minute group discussion, followed by 5 minutes of general Q&A. The chair of your session will strictly enforce these timings so please make sure you can present your paper in no more than 15 minutes. You should use your own laptop to present. HDMI and USB adaptors will be available. If you will need sound, or have any other special requirements, then please contact Cristina Alexandru, who heads up the local organisation team.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Poster presentations</h4>
                    <p>Poster sessions will take place on Friday morning (September 5th) across two timeslots. Before each poster presentation session, presenters will be asked to present a 'lightning talk' of their poster. Please check the programme for details on which session you are presenting and the order of presentations.</p>
                    
                    <p>During the lightning talks, presenters will have 1 minute to present their work and invite the audience to visit their poster. A single slide with your poster title/name(s) will be displayed during each lightning talk. Please keep within the 1 minute time allowance, as we have a limited amount of time before presentations. We propose that all presenters stand in a line in order of their presentations to minimise changeover time.</p>
                    
                    <p>During the poster session, presenters will have the opportunity to share their work and gather feedback. Poster boards will be provided to attendees to display their work (maximum A0 size in portrait orientation). Local printing is not available so you should print your poster in advance and bring it with you.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> At least one author must register for the conference and attend in person to present a poster.</p>

                 <p>A vibrant Computer Science Education (CSE) Community of Practice is emerging in the UK and Ireland (UK&I), promoted by national and international professional body/learned society specialist interest groups and supported through a number of CSE research and practice conferences. This workshop explores how this community of practice addresses the needs of new computer science academics to UK&I higher education and what opportunities there are to bring together and develop new academics as a part of this community. The complex and contesting demands of teaching, research and managing (courses and modules) in UK&I higher education make the early career of an academic challenging and potentially lonely. Typically, initial mentoring of early career academics is via the host Department providing support for working towards a Fellowship of Higher Education Academy.
At this workshop attendees will participate in a qualitative research exercise and develop a proposal to further promote the value of early career academics engaging with CSE research to enhance and develop their own research activities. In particular, addressing:
<ol>
<li>What current and future opportunities are there to establish a national mentorship scheme for early career academics. What format would such a scheme take and how can it be used to facilitate the development of CSE research. </li>
<li>How can the subject community establish, develop and support a buddying scheme for early career academics. How can such a network be developed to stimulate the growth of CSE research. </li>
<li>How can we continue to raise the profile of early career academics engaging in CSE research?</li>
</ol> </p>

                 <br/>
                 <p>My experience shows me that students fear team assessments in general, and that this is even more common in computing science due to our longer term, or year-long student group projects. Staff also discuss these issues too. We can borrow ideas from the software development industry, and other professions to guide us towards solutions.
This workshop builds on previous ones done with MSc IT students as they prepare for the term-long group project as the final part of their degree, and aims to provide participants an experiential opportunity to explore the concerns their students have raised to see if collectively they might co-create solutions with fellow participants. Afterwards they can use the handouts and experience to guide their implementation of the workshop with their students.</p>

                 Kelly Widdicks, <em>Lancaster University</em>.<br/>

                 <br/>
<p>Only 18% of Computer Science (CS) undergraduate students in 2018 were women ; academia and apprenticeships are also seeing fewer and fewer women choosing to pursue CS. This failure to engage women in CS education and training is recognised at a career-level too, with women comprising only 16% of UK IT professionals. Following this, efforts have been made to encourage women in the field, including initiatives that celebrate women in CS, and inclusive CS education principles such as EngageCSEdu. UK universities and academic institutions have also set gender equality commitments through the Athena Swan Charter, aiming to create inclusive environments for all students and staff. However, women are still under-represented in the sector, and prior work has shown that a main reason for this is that women do not feel a sense of belonging in CS. Through this workshop, we aim to build upon a focus group structure designed to uncover reasons for not belonging, and ideate solutions to overcome this, to create a collaborative space at UKICER 2021 where experts and professionals can reflect on their own experiences of belonging and their knowledge of CS education. By doing this, we aim to co-design solutions with the community that will help foster all students' belonging, regardless of their gender identity or membership of any underrepresented group. We also aim to gain participants' feedback and insights for future iterations of the innovative focus groups that can be utilised and applied for other underrepresented groups and in other institutions, departments or settings.

                 <h6>Hermeneutic phenomenology for computing education research</h6>
                 Sue Sentance, <em>Raspberry Pi Foundation</em>.<br/>

                 <br/>
                 <p>There are many different approaches to qualitative research which can be used in empirical studies, but often in computing education research we do not specify exactly the approach we are using. A phenomenological approach, which can be descriptive or hermeneu- tic (interpretive), involves investigating the 'lived experience' of research participants. It relates to the whole research process, not just to how we analyse data. Hermeneutic phenomenology is one approach that has been widely used in some fields, for example, in nursing research and general education, but is rarely, if at all, used in computing education research. As research within computing education may benefit from hermeneutic phenomenology, the pur- pose of this workshop is to introduce this methodology and offer participants some first-hand experience of approaching a study through a phenomenological lens.</p>

                 <h6>Measuring the Difference Between Student and Staff Perception of Self-Efficacy and Confidence Using Online Tools</h6>
                 Laura Heels, <em>Newcastle University</em>.<br/>
                 Becky Allen, <em>Newcastle University</em>.<br/>
                 <br/>
                 <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shift in how we teach, how students learn, but has also drawn attention to the inequalities of pedagogy [1]. These inequalities have exacerbated the already known issues relating to student's self-efficacy, metacognition and confidence [2]. We present a workshop designed to discuss best practice in relation to online learning, with discussions about its capacity to promote self-regulated learning and improve student confidence in their technical skills [3]. The workshop will present a tool which addresses some of the barriers and difficulties students may encounter when learning AI [4]. We then ask participants for their thoughts on improving student self-efficacy and inclusive learning. Participants will leave the workshop with a greater under- standing of these concepts and best practice they can implement within their own teaching.</p>
